Hello team!

Just a few things to get you up to speed:

1) The "Log In" and "Sign Up" screen are pretty self-explanitory, so I'll elaborate on the chat screen only:

- The main section is separated into two main components (both of which have the 'chatInterface' class): the 'chatList' and the 'chatWindow', occupying a third and two-thirds of the screen respetively. Both have a dedicated header, "content" and footer sections.

- 'chatList' contains (currently 4) contacts, and scrolls upon overflowing vertically. The modal pop-up for the 'Add Contact' button is almost unchanged from the default settings.

- 'chatWindow' contains a conversation for the upmost contact. It's basically an unordered list of elements with a "speech-bubble-left" and "speech-bubble-right" classes. Scrolls vertically as well.

2) I was in a rush to finish the first assignment, so there's still two bugs on the 'chat_screen' page that need fixing (I guess they're technically by design since I mostly jerry-rigged it):

- When scaling the viewport to less than the medium (768px) breakpoint on the X-axis, the chatlist and the chatwindow stack vertically.

- The "Log Out" button is set in a fixed position (the top-right corner of the viewport). If you really wanted to, you could scale the viewport to it's smallest size, resulting in said button overlapping the chat interface.

3) I'm sure there's a bunch of superfluous code, mostly in the CSS file. I suggest you take a minute to go over it to see what can be removed/organized better.

4) I'm absolutely not attached to the design, so feel free to change whatever you want about it (and do tell if you come up with a better concept than "dark-mode by default"). The profile pictures and names are also arbitrary.

That's it for now. Good luck! :)
